                        <p><span>
                            We offer a very effective ayurveda treatment for Migraine. It is a widespread  health issue. Studies show that 10-15 per cent of Indians suffer from migraine issues. Prevalence in women is three times more than in men and has been related to the menstrual cycle and menopause.  Migraine triggers include :
                        </span></p><ul>
                            <li>High stress, anxiety, anger</li>
                            <li>Hormonal fluctuations in women</li>
                            <li>Irregular sleep</li>
                            <li>Some type of allergy/eating habits</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><span>
                            Migraine is a form of excruciating, periodic headache allied with digestion and
                            neurological disorders. Symptoms accompanying a migraine attack include :
                        </span></p><ul>
                            <li>Severe pain (unilateral), throbbing, pricking and pounding in the head.</li>
                            <li>Nausea, vomiting, dizziness</li>
                            <li>Loss of appetite, numbness and fatigue in the body</li>
                            <li>Sensitivity to sound, light and smell.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><span>
                            Visual disturbances include seeing spots or stars, zigzag lines, loss of vision in one eye, or blurred vision.
                        </span></p>
                        <p><span>
                            Some may experience the attack daily; others may have it once or twice a month. The duration of attacks may last between four to 72 hours, in some cases.  The pain of a migraine headache is generally moderate to severe, and can disturb our normal activities and spoil general wellbeing. Although a variety of pain relievers are available to treat a migraine, it only suppresses the pain. The problem persists in the body and prolonged use of painkillers have been known to cause severe side effects. Ayurveda provides a safe and natural treatment for complete cure.

                        <p><span>
                            Ayurveda follows a different way to deal with migraines — it tends to be result-oriented, not process-oriented. It treats the patient as an individual case and not as a generic group.

                        </span></p><h3>Treatment</h3>
                        The specialty of Ayurveda lies in the concept of diagnosing the disease and achieving complete cure. It focuses on the root cause of the disease. Toxins (ama) and aggravation of dosha are the main causes of the disease.  So, effort can be made by removing the toxins from the body, (by adopting various purificatory procedures) and stimulating the digestive fire to stop further production of ama and balancing the dosha.
                        <p></p>
                        <p><span>
                            In order to that, Ayurveda has formulated some treatments (upakarmas) such as :
                        </span></p><ul>
                            <li>Shiro Pichu</li>
                            <li>Shiro Dhara</li>
                            <li>Pradhana Karmas (Main treatment)</li>
                            <li>Virechana (Purgation Therapy)</li>
                            <li>Basti (Enema Therapy)</li>
                            <li>Nasya</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><span>
                            These have been proven to be effective and powerful self-healing processes, which help the body to eliminate toxins and to stop further production of toxins, strengthen the immune system in order to become more resistant to illnesses, enhance the body’s ability to be self-reliant, show vitality and mental clarity. It also brings about deep relaxation and a sense of well-being.
                        </span></p>
                        <p><span>
                            Along with these treatments, internal medicines (herbo-mineral compounds) play an important role in curing this disease. According to the principles of Ayurveda, if proper treatment is given at the right time, there is a fair chance of recovering from it for good.

                        Memory loss can affect anyone, but it may be especially serious among the elderly. If your memory fails regularly, you could be suffering from either psychological stress or a physical disorder. Indian Ayurvedic practitioners see a connection between mind and body, and thus treat memory loss holistically by using diet, yoga and herbs. Speak to a qualified health care provider for an accurate diagnosis before starting herbal treatment.

                        </span></p><h2>Depression</h2>
                        Incredible Ayurveda is one of the well-known ayurvedic centers in India that provides very effective traditional ayurvedic treatments for depression.<br /><br />
                        Depression is a mental illness, which involves the body, moods and thoughts of a person. It is normally characterized by sadness, feelings of hopelessness, change in weight, thoughts of death or suicide and similar symptoms. Depression adversely affects the routine work and life of a person leaving him sad, lazy, tired, unmotivated, irritable and indifferent. It affects his friendly relationships, family responsibilities, social behavior and overall performance.<br /><br />
                        Life changes-such as the birth of a baby- divorce, losing a job or the death of loved ones, can and do leave people feeling depressed, so can worrying about financial problems or illness. At times, you may feel empty and depressed for no apparent reason. Some depression is normal and is part of almost every person’s life. Whatever may be the cause, depression can be treated.<br /><br />
                        Symptoms of depression are continuous feeling of sadness or blankness, feeling of helplessness, hopelessness, guilt and worthlessness, loss of interest in pleasurable activities including sex, fatigue, sleep disturbances, loss of energy or enthusiasm, difficulty in concentrating or making decision, headaches, digestive disorders, crying and fearfulness, poor appetite with weight loss, over eating and weight gain etc. Depression is not a disease; it is just a typical sign of imbalance in one’s body. If left untreated, depression can cause further complications in the body.<br /><br />
                        we offers effective treatment of depression without any negative side effects. We advocate certain guidelines about diet and life-style, which have to be pursued by depressed patients. Meditation and moderate exercises help move the blocked emotions and hormones off the body and assists in improving the processing power. Meditation is a safe and simple way to bring coordination between a person’s physical, mental and emotional states. It helps to promote faster and better relief from depression. Ayurvedic oil massages increases blood circulation, revitalizes the body, clears the toxins from the tissues, cools the mind and soothes emotions, thus improving overall balance and health. Ayurvedic rasayanas improves metabolism and help invigorate cell growth, also speeding up the replacement of weak and dead cells with new, vital ones. It aids the body’s natural resistance to stressful situations and for maintaining emotional stability. <br /><br />
                        Ayurvedic physicians have suggested simple and effective natural remedies to overcome depression. Ayurveda thus help in building up balanced emotions, self-confidence, enthusiasm and a feeling of contentment within a person. Treatment for depression takes about 15 to 20 days.

                        </span></p><h2>Epilepsy</h2>
                        Epilepsy (seizure disorder, fits) is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent instances of seizure or tremors. These are due to abnormal excitation from brain. Epilepsy treatment methods are aimed at controlling the disease. Most cases of juvenile epilepsy don't pass over to adulthood.<br /><br />
                        Not all epilepsy cases are alike. Sometimes there can be apparent reasons like stress, brain injury, genetic conditions and parasitic infection of brain. It is also observed that instance of epilepsy can occur without any solid provable reason.<br /><br />
                        Epilepsy due to specific reasons like use of certain drugs, epilepsy as withdrawal symptom, seizure due to abnormal levels of sodium in blood are temporary cases and will be cured without any special treatments apart from the medicines and diet to return to normal health.

                        </span></p><h3>Epilepsy treatment in Ayurveda</h3>
                        Apasmara or apasmaram is the term used for epilepsy in Ayurveda. The reasons sited by Ayurveda scripts include stressful life, lazy life, poor diet and suppression of natural urges.<br /><br />
                        Each person is different and each case of epilepsy is also different. Thorough examination of the patient by an Ayurvedic physician is essential to identify the right treatment for a person.<br /><br />
                        Epilepsy in most cases is a vata disorder. However, it can also be caused by vitiation of pitta or kapha. Imbalances of all the three doshas are also not very rare.<br /><br />
                        Vata type seizure is mainly a mental problem. Stressful days, poor sleep and mental exertion are reasons. Digestive problems like gastritis, constipation etc. can also be reasons.<br /><br />
                        Rest, normalized diet and specific time to take food can help such persons control epilepsy. Abhayanga or Ayurvedic oil massage, shirodhara (pouring of medicated oil over head), thalam (retaining medicated oil on head) helps in pacifying mind. Nerve tonic herbs like Aswagandha (Withania somnifera), Brahmi (Bacopa monniera), Jatamamsi (Nardastachys jatamansi), Shanka pushpi (Evolvulus alsinoides) etc are used to pacify nervous system and to reduce instances of abnormal brain functioning.<br /><br />
                        Inflammations inside head due to diseases like Encephalitis cause pitta type seizures. Exposure to heat is a high risk factor in such cases of seizures. Kapha type epilepsy is due to blocks in central nervous system. A sedentary or highly secluded life can lead to this condition.
                        Kapha type epilepsy is also characterized by excess salivation. Tulsi (holy basil), Acorus calamus, etc are the type of herbs beneficial in kapha epilepsy.

                        </span></p><h3>Prevention of Epilepsy Ayurveda way</h3>
                        Regulate the lifestyle with Ayurvedic daily routine (dinacharya).<br /><br />
                        Stay as much positive about the day and life as possible. Don't allow tensions to creep in to your mind. Don't get excited at anything. Start practicing yoga meditation.<br /><br />
                        Keep your daily diet fully nutritive. Don't eat late at night. If possible go for five or six small meals a day, instead of one or two big meals.<br /><br />
                        Massage your soles with coconut oil or sesame oil before going to bed. This give your head a cooling effect.

                        <p><span>
                        </span></p><h2>Insomnia</h2>
                        According to ayurveda, the amount of sleep you need depends on your mind-body constitution or body type. People with Kapha constitution need the most sleep - about eight or nine hours in order to feel rested. Pittas are next, with a need of seven to eight hours. Vatas can manage with six to seven hours of sleep.<br /><br />
                        Your requirements of sleep also depends on what stage of life are you in. Babies can sleep as much as 15 or 16 hours out of every 24. Children frequently sleep 10 hours or more. At the other extreme, elderly people rarely enjoy a sound, unbroken sleep of more than four or five hours.<br /><br />
                        Ayurveda considers childhood to be the Kapha stage of life. Adulthood is Pitta time, and old age is the Vata stage of life. So the same principle applies here as with body types: we need the most sleep during the Kapha stage, the least during Vata time.
                        <h3>How Much Sleep Do You Need ?</h3>
                        Your sleep needs are largely determined by your Ayurvedic body type :<br /><br />
                        <em>Vata = 6-7 hours</em><br />
                        <em>Pitta = 7-8 hours</em><br />
                        <em>Kapha = 8-9 hours</em>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><span>
                        </span></p><h3>Causes of Insomnia from Ayurvedic Perspective</h3>
                        Ayurveda recognizes two main causes for insomnia :
                        <h4>Aggravated Vata</h4>
                        Vata governs movement everywhere in the body. An unbalanced Vata creates the environment conducive to the initiation of insomnia - the inability to sleep well.<br /><br />
                        Signs of Vata aggravation include anxiety, worry, fear, and restlessness. Each of these can also cause disturbed Vata. Stress, excessive exercise or sexual activity for your body type, eating a too- light diet, fasting, staying up late all create agitation in the central nervous system and throw Vata out of balance. (You don't even have to have a Vata body type to have an aggravated vata.)
                        <p></p>
                        <p><span>
                        </span></p><h4>Disturbances of Routine</h4>
                        When you break your own regular habit patterns, you are prone to get insomnia. Examples are: crossing time zones when traveling or staying up late working several nights in a row. These disturbances in our daily routine puts us out of synch and it seems we cannot get back into our usual rhythm and then can't seem to get back into synch.<br /><br />
                        According to ayurveda, nature also has its own rhythm. Insomnia can result when we are out of harmony with nature's regular patterns. The natural cycles run through phases of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. We are healthiest when we organize our lives in tune with nature's rhythms.<br /><br />
                        Both of these causes - vata aggravation and disturbances of routine - can easily be corrected by Ayurvedic methods.

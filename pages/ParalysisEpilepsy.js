                              <p><strong>Ayurvedic Treatments for</strong> <strong>Paralysis</strong><br/>
                                Ayurveda terms  paralysis as pakshavada, a disorder caused by   the vitiation of vata dosha.  Ayurvedic treatments for paralysis will   aim to rectify the vitiated vata dosha.  In the ayurveda system of   medicine vata is responsible for the proper  coordination of all   voluntary movements in the human body. A constraint in the  proper   movement of vata can cause paralysis in a person.<br/>
                                Internal  medicines will be given in addition to purification   therapies like vasti,  abhyangam, kizhi, siro dhara, thalam, njavara   kizhi etc. to bring the patient  back to normalcy after the removal of   toxins. Purification process will be  undertaken only after a complete   diagnosis of the patient: the condition of  patient, duration of disease   and whether actual cause of the disease is  hemorrhage, emboli or   ischemia. Specific exercises will be helpful in some  patients. Yoga and   meditation is found to be very effective and is also part of  the   ayurveda treatment for paralysis.<br/>

                            <h3>Epilepsy</h3>
                              <p>Epilepsy or Apasmara in Ayurveda is a neurological disorder   characterized by  sudden recurring fits of seizures with or without loss   of conscience. It is a  neurological disorder which can occur either as   a symptom of a brain diseaseor without any known pathology. An   epileptic attack may range from  mild episodes of progressive numbing of   a part of the body to sudden  involuntary contractions of the muscles. <br/>
                                It is  generally characterized by ‘clinical events’&nbsp;called   seizures featured by  instantaneous loss of memory with or without spasm   of body (generalized or  localized). Violent convulsions, twitching of   the muscles, biting of the  tongue, distorted fixation of thumb,   rotation of the head etc are a few of the  other symptoms seen in   patients suffering from epilepsy. Factors like  deprivation of sleep,   high fever, use of alcohol, alcohol withdrawal, mental  stress etc can   trigger seizures.&nbsp;<br/>
                          According  to Ayurveda, epilepsy is a result of the vitiation of   the vata dosha which  particularly affects the head. However, it can   also be caused by vitiation of  pitta or kapha. Sometimes external   situations combine with internal doshasto  cause this disease, but   external events can never be the sole cause. It is  described as   Apasmara or apasmaram in Ayurveda.</p>

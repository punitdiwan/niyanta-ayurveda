                             Hijama is the best remedy recommended and used by the Messenger (saw). The
                            Messenger (saw) said, "Indeed the best of remedies you have is  Hijama "
                            <em>[Saheeh al-Bukharee (5371)].</em><br /><br />
                            The Prophet (saw) enhanced this practice by prescribing specific times
                            at which to perform Hijama Therapy in order to derive the most benefit
                            and by stipulating the preferred areas of the body to perform Hijama to
                            facilitate and promote good health and wellbeing as a preventative measure
                            against the onset of ill health.

                            Hijama is a method of relieving local congestion by applying a partial vacuum
                            that is created in a cup(s), either by heat or by suction. Cupping has been
                            used for thousands of years. Although it is often associated with Traditional
                            Chinese Medicine, the entire world once knew this of therapy and used it. The
                            Ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Chinese used cupping therapy. The oldest
                            recorded medical textbook, Ebers Papyrus, written in approximately 1550
                            BCE in Egypt, mentions cupping (Curtis, 2005). In the UK, the practice of
                            cupping therapy also dates back a long time in one of their leading medical
                            journals, The Lancet. It was named after this practice as it refers to the
                            surgical instrument that can scrape the skin to perform a style of
                            cupping.<br /><br />

                          Hijama is the best remedy recommended and used by the Messenger (saw). The Messenger (saw) said, "Indeed the best of remedies you have is  Hijama " [Saheeh al-Bukharee (5371)]. He also said that on the night of Al-Israa (his ascension to the heavens) he  did not pass by an angel except that it said to him, "Oh Muhammad, order your Ummah (nation) with  Hijama." [Saheeh Sunan Tirmidhee (3479)].<br /><br />

                            'Hijama' in arabic is derived from 'hajm' which means 'sucking'.  Hijama is the process of applying cups to various points on the body by removing the air inside the cups to form a vacuum. In terms of following the Sunnah the cupping that is referred to is 'Bleeding cupping'. It is the most frequently used, oldest, and often the most effective method. A surgical instrument
                            is used to scrape the skin and the cup is then applied to collect blood.

                            Cupping in itself can be done in various forms such as:<br />
                            <h4>Bleeding cupping - Sunnah Cupping</h4>
                        </div>
                        <br /> 
                        Bleeding cuping or wet cupping as it is referred to sometimes, is the Sunnah method and is the oldest, most frequently used and often the most effective method of cupping. A surgical instrument is used to pierce the skin and the cup is then applied to collect blood. Most Muslim cupping therapist are trained for the Sunnah cupping points on the body. This is the area on the back, in between the shoulder blades, slightly towards the neck. There are other cupping points too, however for someone who just wants cupping done to follow the Sunnah, that is mainly the area that the therapist will apply the cups.
                        <br />   <br />   <h4>Moving Cupping or Massage Cupping</h4>
                        This is a great method of massage and is done by applying oil to the skin and moving the cup, by a weak suction, on the area to be treated.
                        <br />   <br />  <h4>Herbal Cupping</h4>
                        A suitable herbal tincture is put into the cup and then suction is applied.
                        <br />   <br />  <h4>Hot Cupping</h4>
                        Dried mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) leaves, sometimes called by its Oriental name, Moxa, is a great warming herb. A needle is used, warmed by dried mugwort and then the cup is applied over the needle.
                        <br />   <br /> <h4>Water Cupping</h4>
                        This is the least practiced method. It involves filling a third of the cup with warm water. Whilst holding the cup close to the client with one hand, it is brought to the point to be cupped and then burning cotton wool is inserted into the cup, then swiftly and simultaneously the cup is turned onto the skin. When performed properly, no water spillage occurs.

                        Cupping is a cure for every disease if performed in the correct places and correct amount. The Messenger (saw) said, "Indeed in  Hijama there is a cure." <em>[Saheeh Muslim (5706)]</em>. Also said, "Whoever performs  Hijama on the 17th, 19th or 21st day (of the Islamic, lunar month) then it is a cure for every disease." <em>[Saheeh Sunan abu Dawud (3861)]</em>.

                        <p></p><h3>Is Hijama painful ?</h3>
                        Hijama is not painful, however to give you and idea it is probably similar to having a blood test.
                        Hijama is not as intrusive as a blood test though as it does not penetrate the veins.<p></p>

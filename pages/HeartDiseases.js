                        <em>Cardiovascular Disease</em> is any of a number of specific diseases that affect the heart itself and/or the blood vessel system, especially the veins and arteries leading to and from the heart. Research on disease dimorphism suggests that women who suffer with cardiovascular disease usually suffer from forms that affect the blood vessels while men usually suffer from forms that affect the heart muscle itself. Known or associated causes of cardiovascular disease include unhealthy ratios of the two smallest lipoproteins (see LDL and HDL), hyperlipidemia (including hypercholesterolemia), elevated blood glucose levels, i.e. diabetes mellitus, upper normal and high blood pressure, i.e.hypertension, Lp-PLA2, lipoprotein(a) and hyperhomocysteinemia, among others.

                            We offer a very effective ayurveda treatment for Sciatica. It is a common type of pain affecting the sciatic nerve, a large nerve extending from the lower back down the back of each leg.

                            Common symptoms of sciatica include:
                            <ul>
                            <li>Pain in the rear or leg that is worse when sitting</li>
                            <li>Burning or tingling down the leg</li>
                            <li>Weakness, numbness, or difficulty moving the leg or foot</li>
                            <li>A constant pain on one side of the rear</li>
                            <li>A shooting pain that makes it difficult to stand up</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><span>
                            Sciatica usually affects only one side of the lower body. Often, the pain extends from the lower back all the way through the back of the thigh and down through the leg. Depending on where the sciatic nerve is affected, the pain may also extend to the foot or toes.

                            For some people, the pain from sciatica can be severe and debilitating. For others, the sciatica pain might be infrequent and irritating, but has the potential to get worse.

                            Sciatica is caused by irritation of the root(s) of the lower lumbar and lumbosacral spine.<br/>
                            Additional common causes of sciatica include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lumbar spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal in the lower back)</li>
                                <li>Degenerative disc disease (breakdown of discs,which act as cushions between the vertebrae)</li>
                                <li>Spondylolisthesis (a condition in which one vertebra slips forward over another one)</li>
                                <li>Pregnancy</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>
                            <p><span>
                            Other things that may make your back pain worse include being overweight, not exercising regularly, wearing high heels, or sleeping on a mattress that is too soft.

                            Sciatica (known as Gridhrasi) is a common ailment that some people suffer as they reach their late thirties. The problem usually occurs from the lower back all the way down the leg. Sciatica can become a very painful condition, with pain shooting up and down all along the sciatica nerve, affecting the buttock, thigh, calf and foot area of one side of the body and in some rare cases, both sides. Various effective treatments for sciatica exist in the ancient medicinal tradition of ayurveda.

                            Ayurveda is fast becoming a buzzword in modern medicine for its use of completely naturally occurring substances for curative purposes. This usually has none or negligible side effects and provides a useful method of alternative therapy. Several ayurveda practitioners have cured sciatica purely based on the ancient ayurvedic texts.

                            While bed rest is one of the most highly recommended ways to ease the pain of sciatica, some other remedies are also suggested. According to some ayurveda scholars, applying a paste of tamarind that has been soaked in salt water, churned, filtered and boiled to form a paste-like consistency to the affected leg is a very effective cure for the ailment. Patients are also usually advised to consume carbohydrates, foods that are rich in fibre, vegetables, and fruits. They are instructed to keep away from sour foods like curd, beans and other pulses, potatoes and fried foods. Some prescribed herbs for external application are nutmeg, juniper, chamomile, vanda orchid, guggulu (gugal), and aloe vera.

                            Yoga is also a part of any ayurvedic treatment plan. While heavy exercises are not recommended for sciatica, light walking and swimming in luke warm water are recommended to ease the pain of sciatica.

                            All ayurvedic treatments must be carried out only under the care of a qualified professional and self medication should be avoided. This is because every patient is different and the treatment for every individual is crafter for the specific needs of that particular individualâ€™s body. We suggest that you use this article as a learning tool, but before adopting any of these remedies, do consult your ayurvedic practitioner.

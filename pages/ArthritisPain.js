                            </p><p>Arthritis  is a medical condition in which an individual suffers from joints pain andstiffness  in his body. Arthritis mostly occurs in aged people and can strike  members of both the sex. <br/>
                                Arthritis  is the result of compression of the nerve roots at the   cervical region as a  result of spondylotic changes and muscular spasm.   There are different forms of  arthritis, of which the most common one is   osteoarthritis (also known as  degenerative joint disease). <br/>
                                According  to Ayurveda, arthritis is caused due to the accumulation of   ama (toxins) in the  human body resulting in the aggravation of vata   (air) dosha. This ama  circulates in the whole body and deposits or gets   collected at the sites which  are weaker. When it deposits in the   joints and at the same time there is  aggravation of vata, it results in   a disease called Arthritis. Weak digestion,  constipation, overeating   and very little physical activity are the symptoms  that can develop in a   patient of arthritis.&nbsp;<br/>

These have been proven effectively over the years. Amongst the various   types of oils sesame oil is the most frequently used in ayurveda for   treating back pains. The various constituents present in the sesame oil   have anti-oxidant and anti-depressant properties, which help to bring   about a sense of well being. </p>

This is   particularly helpful in reducing pain and stiffness. Herbal oils are   applied on the affected joint followed by a localized steam fomentation   of medicines  Ayurveda treatment for gout includes following a diet regime during and   after the treatment. Patients should consume large quantities of fresh,   organic fruits and vegetables.

                                  The great benefit with a majority of this herbal medicine   preparation is that these can be done at our homes itself on the   prescription and advice of an ayurveda physician.

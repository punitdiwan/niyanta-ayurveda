                            We offer a very effective ayurveda treatment for Skin Diseases. Psoriasis is a non-infectious, inflammatory disease of the skin. It is characterized by well-defined erythematous (reddish) plaques with large adherent silvery scales. The main abnormality in psoriasis is an increased proliferation of the skin layers due to excessive division of the cell in the basal layers of the skin. Severe itching may associate with the plaques. Dryness of the skin and silvery scaling are characteristics of this condition.

                            1% to 3% of the most population has Psoriasis. It is very common among Europeans and North Americans. It is often seen between 15 to 40 yrs of age.

                            The exact reason behind Psoriasis is unknown. There is frequently a genetic predisposition. A child with one affected parent has a 15% chance of developing the disease and this rises to 50% if both the parents are affected. Streptococcal infection of the upper respiratory tract may exacerbate the condition. Deprivation of sunlight influences this condition and mental stress plays an important role in aggravating the condition. Certain drugs like chloroquine, chlorpropamide, lithium and practaol may aggravate this condition.

                            The peculiar lesions will be raised and red with dry, silvery-white scaling. Size may vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. Common sites are scalp elbows knees and lower back. Pitting of the nails is very common. Involvements of palm is not uncommon. Many may develop sero-negative inflammatory arthritis, which is characterized by multiple involvements of joints and pitting on nails.

                            Psoriasis Causes: Many basic Ayurvedic texts have explained skin diseases, which resembles Psoriasis. According these references, Psoriasis can be considered as the vitiation of Vata and Kapha. (Two of the basic energies/humors, which maintains our body equilibrium) Accumulation of low potency poisons (Dooshi vishas), are the basic pathological changes taking place in the system. Irregular food habits, consumption of foodstuffs that cannot be eaten together (Eg: diary products with fish), excessive intake of yogurt, black gram, seafood, sour and salted items etc can activate the pathogenesis. Alcohol and tobacco consumption will act as a catalyst here. Ayurveda do emphasize on the effect of stress in the pathogenesis of Psoriasis.

                            The months of July and August represent the varsha ritu or the rainy season. According to Ayurveda, this is the time for pitta aggravation. All the heat that accumulates in the body in the greesham ritu (summer season) is aggravated in the rainy season. There are a number of skin diseases prevalent in the rainy season. Especially in India, this is the time when one can see big crowds in skin clinics. A simple knowledge of Ayurveda can help us prevent and even treat painful skin disorders.

                            According to Ayurveda, the skin has six layers, located not only superficially but extending to the deeper levels of the body. A skin disease is, mostly, rooted deeply into various dhatus or tissues like fat, muscles, blood etc. Most skin treatments are generally external applications like creams or oils. These, however, never reach the deeper layers of the skin. As a result, the symptoms disappear temporarily, and the disease is not rooted out permanently. Ayurveda always tries to root out the disease by treating it specifically according to its cause. As the disease is deepseated it is difficult to fix the problem quickly. Ayurvedic skin treatments may take a few weeks to remove the symptoms but the diseases are treated permanently.

                            <h3>Causes</h3>
                            <p><span>
                            Two of the main causes of diseases in Ayurveda are a wrong diet and lifestyle, which an individual follows either knowingly or unknowingly. Following a diet or life style that is against the season or the prakriti (nature) of a person, creates an imbalance in bodily energies, thus contaminating the body tissues to produce a skin disease. In Ayurvedic terms, although skin diseases are caused due to imbalances in all the three doshas, the prime dosha involved is pitta. Pitta symbolizes heat or fire. Therefore all those foods or activities that increase the fire element in the body should be eliminated. This includes hot, spicy, fried, oily and greasy foods. Acidic foods like tomatoes, citrus fruits, yogurt and vinegar should be avoided. Exposure to heat and sun, drinking too much tea, coffee, and alcohol, and smoking also aggravate the pitta.

                            Eczema or dermatitis, as it is sometimes called, is a group of skin problems, which can affect all age groups. The severity of the disease can vary. The skin turn out to be dry because of the excessive loss of moisture from the upper layer of the skin and thus causing itching sensation and scratching of the affected areas may even lead to bleeding. The skin thus becomes exposed to bacteria and viruses. The general predisposing causes are age, family tendency, allergy, debility, climate and psychological factors.

                            Eczema usually occurs in infancy, at puberty and menopause. There is usually a family history of occurrences of allergy, such as asthma, eczema and hay fever. General physical debility predisposes one to eczema by lowering the resistance of the individual. Climatic extremes as heat, dampness and severe cold: and psychological stress promotes the development of eczema. Local factors, for example, dry and greasy skin, excessive sweating and varicose veins predisposes to eczema. The signs and symptoms of “pama” and “vicharchika” that are described in Ayurveda may be correlated with eczema or dermatitis.

                            Eczema can be grouped into two- exogenous and endogenous. The allergic and irritant type of eczema comes under the exogenous group and the types that come under the endogenous group are atopic, asteatotic, discoid, seborrhoeic, localized neurodermatitis and pompholyx. Atopic dermatitis is the most common type and is seen in babies and children. In the exogenous type of eczema, no secretions are seen from the patches while in the endogenous type of eczema, water may appear from the patches.
